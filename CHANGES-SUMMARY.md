## 💡 Key Improvements

1. **Simpler**: No Mapbox setup required
2. **Flexible**: Scan optional, not mandatory
3. **Faster**: No external API dependencies
4. **Clearer**: Visual badges show scan status
5. **Production-ready**: Easy Render deployment
6. **Self-hosted AI**: No Hugging Face needed

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **AI Accuracy**: 66.7% - moderate, could be better
   - Solution: Retrain with more diverse images
   - Workaround: Scanning is optional

2. **Render Free Tier**: Backend sleeps after 15 min
   - First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake
   - Consider $7/month paid plan for always-on

3. **JPG Image Format**: Some .jpg files fail to load
   - PNG files work perfectly
   - Most phones take JPG, so this needs fixing
   - Quick fix: Convert images or update TensorFlow config
