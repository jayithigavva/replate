## 🔍 **Important Notes**

### AI Scanning:
- **Optional** - not mandatory
- Current accuracy: ~67%
- Works best with clear, well-lit photos
- Takes 5-10 seconds
- Shows confidence percentage

### Backend (Render Free Tier):
- Sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request wakes it (30-60 seconds)
- After wake-up, works instantly
- Consider this when testing

### Real-Time Updates:
- NGO dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- Pull-to-refresh also available
- New pickups appear automatically

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### When Restaurant Creates Pickup:
```
Restaurant submits → Backend saves → Database updated → NGO sees in list
(Instant) (1 sec) (10 sec max)
```

### When NGO Accepts:
```
NGO accepts → Backend updates → Restaurant can see status
(Instant) (1 sec) (Real-time)
```

---

## ⚠️ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue: Backend not responding
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if backend is up:
curl https://replate-backend-h51h.onrender.com/health

# If sleeping, first request wakes it (wait 60 seconds)
```

### Issue: App shows "Network Error"
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Backend might be sleeping (wait 60 seconds, retry)
- Clear Expo cache: Press 'c' then 'r'

### Issue: AI scan takes too long
**Solution:**
- Normal: 5-10 seconds
- If longer than 30 seconds, check backend logs
- Try a smaller image
- Try without scanning (it's optional!)

### Issue: Pickups not appearing for NGO
**Solution:**
- Wait 10 seconds for auto-refresh
- Or pull down to refresh manually
- Check if restaurant actually submitted
- Verify backend is responding
